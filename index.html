<h2>Star is Born</h2>
<p>hello This is the chabot that <strong>provides information of <u>movies</u></strong>
2018's <a href="https://movie.naver.com/movie/bi/mi/basic.nhn?code=168050" target="_blank" title="movie specification">A Star Is Born</a> has a lot to love. In a film that receives ticks for outstanding in many areas, it is a gritty and powerful portrait of two talented people falling in love while also dealing with fame, jealousy and addiction in the public eye. It is a tremendous achievement in both film and music and to say it is a solid directorial debut by Bradley Cooper would be an understatement.</p>
